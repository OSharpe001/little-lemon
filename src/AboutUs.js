                    <p>
                        Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and
                        Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their
                        shared dream of owning a restaurant.

                    <p>
                        To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his
                        experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the
                        marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand
                        the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional
                        cuisines from the mediterranean region.

                        Based in New York City, the chefs draw inspiration
                        from Italian, Greek, and Turkish cultures and have a menu
                        of 12-15 items that they rotate seasonally.
                        The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with
                        moderate prices, making it a popular place for lunch or
                        dinner, especially with friends.
