                            Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and
                            Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their
                            shared dream of owning a restaurant.
                            The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with
                            moderate prices, making it a popular place for a meal any
                            time of the day.
