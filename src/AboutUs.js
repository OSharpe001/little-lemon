                <h1>A Little About Us</h1>
                <article>
                        <p>
                            Little Lemon is owned by two Italian brothers, Mario and
                            Adrian, who moved to the United States to pursue their
                            shared dream of owning a restaurant.

                        <p>
                            To craft the menu, Mario relies on family recipes and his
                            experience as a chef in Italy. Adrian does all the
                            marketing for the restaurant and led the effort to expand
                            the menu beyond classic Italian to incorporate additional
                            cuisines from the mediterranean region.

                            Based in New York City, the chefs draw inspiration
                            from Italian, Greek, and Turkish cultures and have a menu
                            of 12-15 items that they rotate seasonally.
                            The restaurant has a rustic and relaxed atmosphere with
                            moderate prices, making it a popular place for lunch or
                            dinner, especially with friends.
